# LAB_MuCLEO_L432KC_STM32CubeIDE
This repository contains code examples for the MuCLEO_L432KC, a clone of the Nucleo L432KC board. Designed for Supmicrotech ENSMM students, these projects use STM32CubeIDE and HAL to showcase the microcontroller's features in various practical scenarios. Each directory represents a unique project, providing hands-on learning experiences.
